# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### ⚠️ Behavior Changes

- **Abbreviated long options are rejected**: every mflux CLI now requires flags to be written in full, so `--prom` no longer stands in for `--prompt`. Option provision is detected by scanning `argv`, which cannot see abbreviations, and an abbreviation that is unambiguous today starts resolving elsewhere the moment a new flag is added. Anything scripted with a shortened flag needs the full spelling. (#499)

### ✨ Improvements

- **Silently dropped CLI options now warn**: a command that accepts an option it cannot honour says so at parse time instead of ignoring it, for example `--guidance` on a guidance-distilled model. Adds `mflux-capabilities`, a machine-readable dump of every image-generating command with its options, defaults, types and the status of each option (honored, ignored, conditional or rejected), in JSON, YAML or Markdown. (#499)

### ✨ Improvements

- **`--vae-tiling` and `--vae-tile-size` flags**: Restore user-facing control over tiled VAE decoding, decoupled from `--low-ram` (previously the only way to enable it). `--vae-tiling` enables tiled decode with the default 512px tiles; `--vae-tile-size 256` shrinks the tiles to further reduce peak decode memory and implies `--vae-tiling`. Both compose with `--low-ram`, whose implicit tiling defaults they override. The original `--vae-tiling`/`--vae-tiling-split` flags were removed in the Z-Image refactor (#284); this restores the capability on top of the generalized `VAETiler`. (#311, #407)
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Ideogram 4 quantization**: `mflux-save -q` now actually quantizes Ideogram 4. Every weight-bearing linear in the model is an `Fp8Linear`, which defined no `to_quantized` and whose components were marked `skip_quantization`, so `-q 4` wrote an FP8 checkpoint stamped `quantization_level: 4` and only the VAE was touched. Adds `Fp8Linear.to_quantized`, drops the skip flags, derives bits and group size from the stored shapes when rebuilding a saved checkpoint instead of assuming q8/group-64, and rebuilds quantized embeddings as embeddings rather than linears. `-q 8` is 26 GB and `-q 4` is 14 GB, both visually indistinguishable from FP8. (#559)

### 📝 Documentation

- **Ideogram 4 gated weights**: Document the `HF_TOKEN` / `hf auth login` step alongside the existing note that access must be approved on the model card — authenticating is the half people miss, and without it an approved account still fails with a bare `401`/`403`. Adds a quantization section covering `mflux-save -q` and loading a saved checkpoint with `--model-path`. (#559)

## [0.18.1] - 2026-08-07

### 🎨 New Model Support

- **Krea 2**: Add text-to-image support for `krea/Krea-2-Turbo` — a single-stream MMDiT built on the Qwen-Image stack (Qwen-Image VAE + a 12-layer Qwen3-VL-4B text-encoder tap). Includes the `mflux-generate-krea2` CLI (live progress, `--metadata`, stepwise output), `er_sde` and Euler samplers, and `mflux-save` quantization caching.
- **Krea 2 Raw + LoRA training**: Add `krea/Krea-2-Raw` as a trainable base and `mflux-train` LoRA training for Krea 2 (flow-matching velocity, QLoRA over the quantized base, gradient checkpointing across the 28 blocks). The transformer also loads from the diffusers `transformer/` shard layout in addition to the native single-file checkpoint, and the official `krea/Krea-2-LoRA-*` adapters load as-is. Train on Raw, run the adapter on Turbo (Krea's recommended workflow). (#462)

### ✨ Improvements

- **Atomic `--lora` and `--image` flags**: Pair each path with its value on a single, repeatable flag — `--lora A.safetensors 0.7 --lora B.safetensors` (scale defaults to `1.0`) and `--image photo.jpg 0.6` (strength defaults to the model default). This removes the positional-alignment footgun of the parallel `--lora-paths`/`--lora-scales` and `--image-path`/`--image-strength` lists, which remain fully supported and are marked deprecated in `--help`. (#438)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Ideogram 4 stepwise output**: Fix `--stepwise-image-output-dir` for Ideogram 4 by routing unpacked latents to `vae.decode` instead of `decode_packed_latents` when channels are already VAE-ready. (#444)

### 📝 Documentation

- **Related projects**: Add [mflux-paint](https://github.com/Amo643/mflux-paint) to the Related projects list. (#471)

### 🧰 DX & Maintenance

- **PyPI trusted publishing**: Publish releases via GitHub Actions OIDC (`pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`) instead of a long-lived `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret.

### ✨ Features

- **LyCORIS LoKr adapters (FLUX.1 and FLUX.2)**: Load community LyCORIS LoKr safetensors through the existing `--lora-paths` / `lora_paths` API. Supports direct and factorized (`lokr_w1_a`/`lokr_w1_b`, `lokr_w2_a`/`lokr_w2_b`, optional `lokr_t2`) tensors, observed LyCORIS key layouts, alpha scaling for decomposed factors, optional `dora_scale`, multi-adapter fusion with classic LoRA, and baking into non-quantized base weights as well as quantized layers (via dequantization and re-quantization). Inference applies the Kronecker product without materializing full dense deltas for standard (non-DoRA) LoKr layers.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-07

### 🎨 New Model Support

- **ERNIE-Image & ERNIE-Image-Turbo**: Port Baidu's ERNIE-Image models with text-to-image CLI entrypoints, LoRA inference and training, and `mflux-save` support.
- **Ideogram 4 FP8**: Add Ideogram 4 FP8 text-to-image support with JSON caption handling, FP8 safetensors loading, and a dedicated CLI entrypoint.

### ✨ Improvements

- **FLUX.2 Klein 9B KV-cache**: Add KV-cache support for `flux2-klein-9b-kv` with roughly 2.4× speedup on multi-reference edit workloads.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **FLUX.2 Klein Edit guidance**: Allow `--guidance > 1.0` for FLUX.2 Klein edits by checking the resolved FLUX.2 model config instead of requiring a base model name; defaults remain unchanged.
- **FLUX.2 Klein `mflux-generate`**: Fix `FileNotFoundError: text_encoder_2` by routing Klein models through `Flux2Klein` and skipping the unused T5/`text_encoder_2` weight path.
- **Memory management**: Evict the text encoder after encoding and clear the MLX cache between seeds on multi-seed runs to prevent OOM on large models such as FLUX.2 Klein 9B.

## [0.17.5] - 2026-04-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Qwen Image Edit `mflux-save`**: Route Qwen edit model names to `QwenImageEdit` and save through the same path as inference so VisionTransformer (`encoder.visual`) weights are written. Saving with `QwenImage` previously omitted those weights and led to random vision encoders after reload.
- **Battery saver callback**: Harden Apple Silicon battery detection when `system_profiler` is missing and resolve the helper script via absolute paths.

### 📝 Documentation

- **Related projects**: Clarify that MindCraft Studio is a macOS app built on mflux.

### 🧰 DX & Maintenance

- **Dependencies**: Relax the `protobuf` upper bound to allow current 7.x releases while keeping a safe ceiling below 8.0.

## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Qwen Image Edit conditioning resolution**: Encode the transformer’s image-conditioning latents at the edit target resolution, not the vision-language conditioning resolution (≈384px by area), preventing patchy/tiled artifacts in edit outputs.
- **Qwen Image Edit default dimensions**: Preserve the first input image dimensions by default; explicit `--width`/`--height` values or scale factors still opt into resizing.
- **Qwen Image Edit CLI scheduler**: Forward `--scheduler` to the Qwen edit pipeline (previously ignored).
- **Qwen Image Edit q4 saving**: Use mixed q4/q8 quantization for Qwen transformers by saving image-stream modulation (`*.img_mod_linear`) at q8 and the rest of the quantizable transformer linears at q4. Existing all-q4 and BF16 mixed-q4 Qwen checkpoint layouts continue to load.

---

## [0.17.4] - 2026-03-28

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Z-Image PEFT/ModelScope LoRA keys**: Extend the Z-Image LoRA mapping with `.default` tensor name variants so adapters in PEFT/ModelScope layouts (for example Tongyi-MAI exports) resolve and apply correctly instead of matching zero weights.

---

## [0.16.3] - 2026-02-14

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Z-Image training preview guidance**: Fix Z-Image (non-turbo) training previews so they use the configured guidance value instead of defaulting to 0.0, ensuring preview quality matches actual CFG behavior.
- **FLUX.2 training preview guidance**: Fix FLUX.2 training previews (txt2img and edit) so they use the configured guidance value instead of forcing 1.0.

---

## [0.16.2] - 2026-02-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

  - Specify output dimensions relative to input image: `--width 2x --height 2x`
  - Use `auto` to match input image dimensions: `--width auto --height auto`
  - Mix scale factors with absolute values: `--width 2x --height 512`
  - Supported in: `mflux-generate`, `mflux-generate-z-image-turbo`, `mflux-generate-fibo`, `mflux-generate-kontext`, `mflux-generate-qwen`

    - HuggingFace repos: `author/model`
    - **New**: HuggingFace collections: `repo_id:filename.safetensors`
  - Simplified model initialization: just pass `lora_paths` and everything resolves automatically
- **Unified Latent Creator Interface**: Standardized `unpack_latents(latents, height, width)` signature across all model families
  - `FluxLatentCreator`, `ZImageLatentCreator`, `FiboLatentCreator`, and `QwenLatentCreator` now share the same interface
  - Moved `FIBO._unpack_latents` to `FiboLatentCreator.unpack_latents` for consistency
- **StepwiseHandler Refactor**: Fixed `StepwiseHandler` to work with all model types by accepting a `latent_creator` parameter
  - Previously hardcoded to `FluxLatentCreator`, now model-agnostic
  - Each command passes its appropriate latent creator to `CallbackManager.register_callbacks()`
- **CLI Reorganization**: Moved CLI entry points to model-specific directories (e.g., `mflux/models/flux/cli/`)

### 🔄 Breaking Changes

### 📦 Dependency Updates

- **Updated `huggingface-hub`** from `>=0.24.5,<1.0` to `>=1.1.6,<2.0`
  - v1.1.6 includes fix for incomplete file listing in `snapshot_download` which could cause cache corruption
  - Removed explicit `accelerate` and `filelock` dependencies (pulled in as transitive dependencies)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Qwen empty negative prompt crash**: Fixed crash when running Qwen models without a `--negative-prompt` argument. Empty prompts now use a space as fallback to ensure valid tokenization.

- **`--model` flag not working**: Fixed bug where the `--model` argument wasn't being used for loading models from HuggingFace or local paths. All CLI commands now correctly use `--model` for model path resolution.
- **Model Saving Index File**: Fixed issue where locally saved models (via `mflux-save`) would fail to load when uploaded to HuggingFace, due to missing `model.safetensors.index.json`. The model saver now generates this index file alongside the safetensor shards, ensuring compatibility with both mflux and standard HuggingFace loading paths. (see [#285](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/issues/285))

### 🧪 Test Infrastructure

- **Test markers**: Added `fast` and `slow` pytest markers to categorize tests
  - Fast tests: Unit tests that don't generate images (parsers, schedulers, resolution, utilities)
  - Slow tests: Integration tests that generate actual images and compare to references
- **New Makefile targets**:
  - `make test-fast` - Run fast tests only (quick feedback during development)
  - `make test-slow` - Run slow tests only (image generation tests)
  - `make test` - Run all tests (unchanged)
- Run specific test categories: `pytest -m fast` or `pytest -m slow`
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Fast tests now run automatically on PRs and pushes to main

### 🔧 Internal Changes

- Simplified `WeightLoader.load()` to take a single `model_path` parameter instead of separate `repo_id` and `local_path`
- Simplified `TokenizerLoader.load_all()` with the same unified `model_path` interface
- Renamed `local_path` parameter to `model_path` in all model constructors for clarity
- Removed `quantization_util.py` - quantization now handled through `QuantizationResolution`
- Removed `lora_huggingface_downloader.py` - downloading integrated into `LoRAResolution`
- Added comprehensive test coverage for resolution modules
